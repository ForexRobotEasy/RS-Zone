## Program Name
RS Zone

## Description
RS Zone is a forex software that utilizes support and resistance levels to identify reversal points in trading. It calculates support and resistance levels based on the specified Range SR parameter and then uses an algorithm to accurately identify reversal points using these calculated levels.

## Functions

### CalculateSRLevels
```cpp
void CalculateSRLevels(double Range_SR)
```
This function calculates support and resistance levels based on the specified Range SR parameter. The code logic within this function performs the necessary calculations to determine the support and resistance levels.

### CalculateTotalSR
```cpp
int CalculateTotalSR(double Range_SR)
```
This function calculates the total support and resistance (SR) levels within the specified Range SR parameter. The code logic within this function performs the necessary calculations to determine the total SR levels.

### IdentifyReversalPoints
```cpp
void IdentifyReversalPoints()
```
This function uses the calculated support and resistance levels to identify reversal points. The code logic within this function implements an algorithm to accurately identify these reversal points.

### OnInit
```cpp
int OnInit()
```
The main function of the program. It initializes the Range SR parameter, calculates the support and resistance levels, calculates the total SR levels, identifies reversal points, and provides a logical conclusion based on the results. If reversal points are identified, it prints 'Reversal points identified successfully.' Otherwise, it prints 'No reversal points found.'

## Usage
1. Set the Range SR parameter in the OnInit function. This parameter determines the range within which support and resistance levels will be calculated.
2. Call the CalculateSRLevels function to calculate support and resistance levels based on the specified Range SR.
3. Call the CalculateTotalSR function to calculate the total support and resistance levels within the specified Range SR.
4. Call the IdentifyReversalPoints function to accurately identify reversal points using the calculated support and resistance levels.
5. Based on the logical conclusion of the program, it will print either 'Reversal points identified successfully.' or 'No reversal points found.'
